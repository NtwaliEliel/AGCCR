        <p>It was in 1999 that the Lord called his servant Paul Gasigi for full-time pastoral ministry, while he was working as the National Director of various German development projects in Huye; after the confirmation of Divine Call, he resigned and went to the ruined city, called at the time "Rwabayanga", due to the dirt, criminality and misery of its population, where the Lord had already provided land and given to his servant a new prophetic name for the city "Rwayesu" to get it out of this ruin.</p>
